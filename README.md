# Cospaces in Unity: Slippy Map Implementation

This is a seperate Unity project from Xi Sun's original build in the Master branch. I have implemented the use of a slippy map as well as a different touch UI.

The overall goal will be to merge vertain elements from each project into one, and eventually push these changes to the master branch.
